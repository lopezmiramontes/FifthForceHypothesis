Research notes, derivations, and open call for collaboration on a candidate fifth force hypothesis.

## Abstract

A minimal parameterized formulation of a hypothetical fifth fundamental force, motivated by unresolved anomalies in gravitation and cosmology. This project is in an early exploratory phase and is shared publicly to invite open collaboration from the scientific community.

The aim is to provide a mathematically explicit foundation while encouraging contributions in:
- Theoretical derivation and refinement
- Experimental constraint analysis
- Simulation and parameter-space exploration
- Critical peer review
